# Hi there 👋

🌈 I'm Agustina, currently immersed in the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience 🧠🤖

## Academic Background 🎓

- **Currently Studying:** Artificial Intelligence Engineer at University of Palermo
- **Research Focus:** Actively engaged in neuroscientific exploration since 2021 at the CMN, Faculty of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires.

## Research topics 💡

- **2023:** Along with my team Galvan H, Koss P, and Galvan S, we have worked on creating an AI model to detect schizophrenia through the use of tractography outputs. We had the opportunity to present that project at Brainhack, an International Workshop created by the University of Montreal and brought to Argentina by Humai.

- **2022:** I've created 3D brain tools with the purpose of facilitating the understanding of neuroanatomy for medical students at the faculty, and then we had the chance to validate that with teachers from the university. It turned out into a research project presented at the Congress of the International Forum of Biomedical Sciences from the Argentine Association of Clinical Anatomy.

- **2021:** Along with Melgan C and Marchelli A, we did research addressing the legal situation of the consumption of cannabis in refractory epilepsy and presented it at a Conference organized by AECUBA, University of Buenos Aires.

## Professional Journey 🧪

- **Responsibilities:** Coordinating projects in the realm of laboratory services, ensuring smooth execution and client satisfaction.

## A Glimpse into My Vision 🌍

What drives me is a holistic perspective of the present/future, envisioning AI as a catalyst for positive change within our community. My biggest goal is to harness the potential of AI as a bridge, connecting our existing knowledge derived from neuroscience research to practical applications. This endeavor aims to develop tools and solutions that not only will address and mitigate health challenges but also enhance the overall well-being and improve the quality of life for all individuals.
